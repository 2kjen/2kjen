    <p> 👩🏾‍🎓 I am a recent Law graduate! </p>
    <p> 👩🏿‍💻 However, I would like to build a career in Tech! </p>
    <p> 🎨 I know a bit of HTML and CSS from playing around with it over the years, but I would like to brush up on it!</p>
    <p> 🐍 I am currently teaching myself Python! </p>
    <p> 🖥 In the near future, I would like to familiarise myself with Computer Science concepts using <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself Computer Science<a/>!</p>
